# BRDF fitting for Linearly Transformed Spherical Harmonics (LTSH)

Implementation of the BRDF approximation process for LTSH. This Code is reimplementation of the code used in my [Bachelor's Thesis](http://www.jallmenroeder.de/2020/11/19/linearly-transformed-spherical-harmonics/) with improved sampling. The original python implementation used code not intended for publication, so I decided to do an improved reimplementation in C++. 
## Dependencies
The code is built using CMake and C++14. It depends on the [GLM library](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) and [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html) for the minimization algorithms and SH evaluation.
## How to use
